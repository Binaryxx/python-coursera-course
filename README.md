# pythonPractice
Repository that has notebooks and work relating to Python

Files with the "pythonNotes..." naming convention are notes to the Coursera videos that are mandated along with any tangents I had and checked out with the help of W3 Schools

Files with the "pythonExcercises..." naming convention are practice problems to demonstrate my knowledge of Python. This can either be from the Coursera course or from HackerRank. The specifics should be noted in the file itself

The majority of the notes are synthesized info from the videos and labs; some of the code is a direct copy/paste from the lab since it would take too much to simulate making and creating dummy files (these Coursera codes are indicated as such)

Some code I have not had the time to figure out/use which are indicated with the "!!!"; There are also questions and confusion with some concepts which have been marked with the "!!!" as well
  I plan on going back and resolving these
    Refer to the pythonNotesUnresolved for a centralized area where these action items are noted
